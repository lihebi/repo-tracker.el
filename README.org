#+BEGIN_SRC elisp

                           "~/git/note"
                           "~/git/research"

                           "~/.emacs.d"
                           ;; emacs packages
                           "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/smart-scholar.el"
                           "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/simple-drill.el"
                           "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/scribble-mode.el/"
                           "~/.emacs.d/straight/repos/hn.el/"))
#+END_SRC

** Running

Run =repo-tracker=. Key bindings in the buffer:

- =g= (=repo-tracker-refresh=): refresh the status buffer

Run =repo-tracker-fetch-all= to fetch from upstream, so that you can
see whether you are behind upstream. This runs synchronously.


* TODO-List

** TODO high light different things differently
** TODO catch other types of dirtyness
** TODO show only important messages

This package is alpha now, so I need full message to catch all
dirtyness.  I'm delaying this until the package becomes mature.
